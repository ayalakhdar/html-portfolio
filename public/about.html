<center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
<hr />
<p>Rare are the things i can refer to my self as while describing, when asked to introduce my self, i might tell my name, age, hobbies and 
  my current studdies , the answer never satisfies me,it always lacks something since i do not find my self in any of the previous stuff, but still since people
  are not really interested to knowing who i really am so whatever the answer is, it would be enough,and  honestly i myself do not care about the answer. <br />
  What interests me most is if i am able to answer that same question for myself, will i ever be able to describe my self in words that would fully define me, would i be able to involve every aspect, every detail, or even the major things that make who i am if i am ever aware of them. <br />
  I think that words are not supposed to do that, they are not responsible of fully expressing my spirit, they are not enough for the least, so for my whole life 
  i always pursue different forms of art to express my self, art that will speak for me, art that transcends people and implement in them feelings and ideas i can never deliver nor describe .</p>
